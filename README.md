## uikit-webpack
This project is a starter kit and testbed for developing web applicaition components using UI Kit that supports SASS, JavaScript, Babel and Webpack.

I setup SASS loader configs in the webpack.config that makes developing locally faster and easier. 
[Follow this useful guide](https://ideas.byteridge.com/webpack-bundle-your-frontend-apps/) for more info on that.

## Getting up and running
```yarn install
```

### Setup dev environment
```yarn dev
```

### Start a local dev server
```yarn start
```

### Create a new production build
```yarn build
```

## Installing UIKit from scratch
You have the following options to get UIkit:

- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/uikit/uikit/releases/latest) with pre-built CSS and JS.
- Install with [npm](https://npmjs.com) to get all source files as they are available on Github: ```npm install uikit```
- Install with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to get all source files as they are available on Github: ```yarn add uikit```
- Directly load UIkit from [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com): https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/uikit
- Clone the repo to get all source files including build scripts: `git clone git://github.com/uikit/uikit.git`
