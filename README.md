# uikit-webpack
This project is a designer playground for building UI components with UI Kit.

##Â Installing this UIKit play test
```yarn install
```
You can setup a SASS/Less to work with webpack if you like but it needs to compile into the dist folder relative to the index.html.

### Run webpack
```yarn build
```
- Copy index.html and custom.css into the dist folder.

### Start a new local server
```yarn dev
```
## Installing UIKit from scratch
You have the following options to get UIkit:

- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/uikit/uikit/releases/latest) with pre-built CSS and JS.

- Install with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to get all source files as they are available on Github: ```yarn add uikit```
- Directly load UIkit from [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com): https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/uikit
